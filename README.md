# pandas-challenge

**I have documented the summary of my analysis and have drawn my conclusion in the bignning of my code.**

**PART A :**
In this section I have invoked Pandas library,reading the csv files and merging it into a single file.

**PART B :**
1.In this section I have summarized the District Results by finding out various metrics like Total number of unique schools Total students,Total budget,Average math score,
Average reading score,% passing math,% passing reading and % overall passing.

2.Have used different functions like nunique,sum,mean function to calculate number of school and students,budget and average of matah and reading scores respectively.

**PART C :**
1.In this section I have summarized School Summary by finding out various metrics like School name,School type,Total students,Total school budget,Per student budget,Average math score,
Average reading score,% passing math,% passing reading,% overall passing (the percentage of students who passed math AND reading).

2.In this segment have predominently used groupby function and created dataframe to calculate various matrics related to per school/student/subject scores.

**PART D**
1.In this section we are calculating the highest performing schools, bottom performing schhols both based on overall passing, Math scores by grade, reading scores by grade,scores by school spending, scores by school size and scores by school type.

2.In this section I have used groupby function,sort, bins and cut and also created dataframes to determine scores by grade/school size/spending and to calculaet highest and bottom performing schools based on the passing rates.

Executed each code then and there and printed the results.
